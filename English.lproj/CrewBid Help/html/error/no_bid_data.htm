<h2>Error Messages</h2>

<h3>Could not download bid data file</h3>

<p>The most likely cause of an inability to download a bid data file is that the data file for the requested bid period is not available on the SWA server.</p>

<p>The corrective actions for an inability to download a bid data file is to make sure that you have requested a data file for the current bid period. (Normally, bid data files for a bid period are available on the SWA server from the time bidding opens until the end of the month.)</p>
