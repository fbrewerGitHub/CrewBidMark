<p>Error messages are designed to cover the most likely causes of a task failure. Nonetheless, other causes are possible. If you have accomplished the corrective actions and continue to receive the error message, please send an <a href="mailto:support@macrewsoft.com">email</a> with as much detail concerning the error as you can provide. Please include a screen shot of the error message (or the text of the error message) and the operating system you are using.</p>
