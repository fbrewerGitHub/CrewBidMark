<h2>Error Messages</h2>

<h3>Could not connect to the SWA server</h3>

<p>The most likely causes of an inability to connect to the SWA server are:
   <ol>
      <li>You have not established an internet connection prior to requesting bid data for a new bid or prior to submitting a bid, or 
      </li>
      <li>Your computer's date/time may be set incorrectly. (An incorrect date/time setting may prevent the establishment of a secure connection to the SWA server. As all connections to the SWA server are secure, the inability to establish a secure connection will prevent any connection to the SWA server.)
      </li>
   </ol>
</p>

<p>The corrective actions for an inability to connect to the SWA server are:
   <ol>
      <li>Establish an internet connection prior to requesting bid data or submitting a bid, or 
      </li>
      <li>Set your computer's date/time to the current data and time.
      </li>
   </ol>
