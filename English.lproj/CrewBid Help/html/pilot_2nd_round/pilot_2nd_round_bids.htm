<h2>Pilot Second Round Bids</h2>

<p>Some trip data is not available for pilot second round bids. Specifically, those trips that are not part of the first round bid (i.e., those trips constructed for the second round) have only the following data available:

	<ul>
		<li>
		trip number,
		</li>
		<li>
		departure and return times,
		</li>
		<li>
		overnight cities,
		</li>
		<li>
		trip length, and
		</li>
		<li>
		trip pay.
		</li>
	</ul>

To prevent inaccurate sorting, selection, and points assignments, a limited number of choices are available for pilot second round bids.</p>
