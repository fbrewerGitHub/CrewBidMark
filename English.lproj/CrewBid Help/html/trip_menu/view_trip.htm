<h2>View Trip...</h2>


<p>You may view any trip that is included with the bid data for the bid month, domicile, and crew position.</p>

<table bgcolor="#fff8dc">
   <tr bgcolor="#fff8dc">
      <td>
         <font face="Lucida Grande,Helvetica,Arial" size="2">
         To view a trip:
         <ol>
            <li>
               Select the Trip-&gt;View Trip... menu item to bring up the View Trip window and dialog.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               In the View Trip dialog, enter the desired Trip Number and Start Day, then click the OK Button.
            </li>
            
            </li>
         </ol>
         </font>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>Only trips that are part of of the original bid data are available for viewing. Partial trips and trips constructed by crew scheduling for pilot second round bids are not available. Partial trips may be viewed by entering the original pairing number.</p>

<p>If the Start Day text field is left blank or a number less than one is entered, the first day of the bid month will be used to display the trip. If a day greater than the number of days in the bid month is entered in the Start Day text field, the last day of the bid month is used.</p>

<p>The Trip window contains two buttons which allow you to view a different trip or copy legs for the selected trip to the clipboard.</p>
