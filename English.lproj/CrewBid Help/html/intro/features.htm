<h2>CrewBid Introduction</h2>

<h3>CrewBid Features</h3>

<p>Here's a brief description of CrewBid&rsquo;s features.</p>

<h4>Automatic Downloading of Bid Data and Submission of Bid Preferences</h4>

<p>CrewBid can download bid information (line and trip data) from and submit your bid preferences to the company.</p>

<h4>Viewing Line and Trip Information</h4>

<p>CrewBid displays bid information in three views:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>
      line summary, a list of each line with configurable columns of the line's attributes (number, pay, flight time, etc.);
      </li>
      <li>
      calendar, each day's departure time, overnight city, and arrival time for each trip in a monthly calendar format; and
      </li>
      <li>
      individual trip, a view of each leg of a trip with summary information, similar to a trip sheet.
      </li>
   </ul>

<h4>Ordering Lines</h4>

<p>Lines may be placed in order according to your preferences in a variety of ways:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>
      manually, by dragging the line to the desired position;  
      </li>
      <li>
      sorted by attributes;
      </li>
      <li>
      selected by attributes, with lines that have the desired attributes sorted above those that don't; and
      </li>
      <li>
      sorted by points that are assigned to attributes.
      </li>
   </ul>

<p>For more information on the views and how to order your bid preferences, see the Making Bid Choices section under Help Topics.</p>
