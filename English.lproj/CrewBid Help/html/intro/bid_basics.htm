<h2>CrewBid Introduction</h2>

<h3>Bid Basics</h3>

<p>Each month you must prepare and submit your bid preferences.</p>

<p>Early in the month, the company publishes line and trip data for the following month. The data is available as paper-copy in the pilot lounge at your crew base and electronically on the company's web site.</p>

<h4>The Manual Way</h4>

<p>To prepare and submit your bid manually, you perform these steps:

   <ul>
      <li>
      examine the company-provided printed or electronic line and trip information;
      </li>
      <li>
      develop a list of line numbers, sorted in order of your preferences; and
      </li>
      <li>
      submit your bid preferences by entering the line numbers, in your preferred order, in the crew scheduling application available on the company's web site.
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>

<h4>The CrewBid Way</h4>

<p>To prepare and submit your bid using CrewBid, you perform these steps:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>
      examine the automatically-downloaded line and trip data in a variety of formats, including line summary, calendar, and individual trip;  
      </li>
      <li>
      develop a prioritized list of line numbers by sorting lines according to  attributes (pay, days off, etc.), selecting lines that have certain attributes, and manually ordering lines; and
      </li>
      <li>
      submit automatically the entire prioritized list of line numbers to the company.
      </li>
   </ul>
