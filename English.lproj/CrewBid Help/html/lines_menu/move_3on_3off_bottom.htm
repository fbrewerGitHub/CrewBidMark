<h2>Move 3-On/3-Off Lines to Bottom</h2>

<p>You can move all 3-On/3-Off lines to the bottom of the sort order. Once moved to the bottom, the 3-On/3-Off lines will remain at the bottom regardless of sorting order or selections.</p>

<p>A line is considered to be 3-On/3-Off if it consists of only three-day trips, each separated by no more than three days off.</p>

         To move 3-On/3-Off lines to the bottom:
         <ol>
            <li>
               Select the Lines-&gt;Move 3-On/3-Off Lines to Bottom menu item.

         </ol>

      </td>
   </tr>
