<h2>Insert Reserve/MRT Bid</h2>

<p>You can insert a Reserve Bid or an MRT bid into the Lines Table to indicate a Reserve or MRT bid at that point in the sort order. Once a Reserve or MRT bid is inserted, it may be dragged to a new position just like any other line. When the lines are sorted, a Reserve or MRT maintains the same position in the sort order as before the lines were sorted.</p>

<p>The Insert Reserve Bid and Insert MRT bid menu items are enabled for flight attendant first round bids only.</p>
