<h3>Choosing Lines That Do Not Have Overlap</h3>

<p>After clicking the Compute Overlap button in the Overlap Tab, lines that have overlap are indicated in the Lines Table with the pay value colored <font color="brown">brown</font>, as shown in the partial view of the Lines Table below.</p>

<p>Choosing lines with respect to overlap may be performed in the Select/Points tab of the Choices tab view.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
   <tr bgcolor="#fff8dc">
      <td>
         <font size="2">
         To choose lines with respect to overlap: 
         <ol>
            <li>
               Select the Select/Points tab.
            </li>
            <li>
               Select the Overlap item.
            </li>
             <li>
               Select the appropriate checkboxes and enter desired values in the points text fields.
            </li>
        </ol>
         </font>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>In the figure below, lines that have overlap have been assigned a points value of <nobr>-5.00</nobr>. Lines have not been selected by overlap, and no points have been assigned to lines that do not have overlap.</p>
