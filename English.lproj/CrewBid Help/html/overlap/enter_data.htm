<h3>Entering Overlap Data</h3>

<p>Refer to the Overlap Tab example below for the following discussion.</p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/overlap_ex_filled.png"></p>

<p>The left side of the overlap tab contains the Block Time text fields, Release Time text field, and Compute Overlap button, which are used to manually enter data from the previous month's flying schedule and to determine which lines have overlap.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
   <tr bgcolor="#fff8dc">
      <td>
         <font size="2">
         To manually enter data from the previous month's schedule: 
         <ol>
            <li>
               For each date of flying, enter the block (flight) time in the Block Time text field for that date.
            </li>
            <li>
               Enter the release time for the final trip of the previous month in the Release Time text field.
            </li>
         </ol>
         To determine those lines that have overlap, click the Compute Overlap button. 
         </font>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>As block (flight) times are entered in the Block Time text fields, the Release Time text field moves to a position that corresponds to the final date that has flying scheduled. You may enter release times for any date that has flying scheduled, but only the release time for the final date with flying scheduled is used to determine those lines that have overlap.</p>

<p>After all entries for the previous month's flying have been made, clicking the Compute Overlap button will determine those lines that have overlap. Lines that have overlap are indicated in the Lines Table by coloring the Pay for that line <font color="brown">brown</font>.</p>

<p>For an example of manually entering flying schedule data, see the <a href="example.htm">example</a>.</p>
