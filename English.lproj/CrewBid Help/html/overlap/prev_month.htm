<h3>Using Overlap Data From Previous Month</h3>

<p>Refer to the Overlap Tab example below for the following discussion.</p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/overlap_ex_filled.png"></p>

<p>The right side of the overlap tab contains the Previous Month Bid popup button, Line text field, and Use Selected Bid and Line Data button, which are used to automatically enter data from the previous month's bid.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
   <tr bgcolor="#fff8dc">
      <td>
         <font size="2">
         To use data from a previous month bid file: 
         <ol>
            <li>
               Select the appropriate bid file in the Previous Month Bid popup button.
            </li>
            <li>
               Enter the line number awarded from the previous month in the Line text field.
            </li>
            <li>
               Click the Use Selected Bid and Line Data button.
            </li>
         </ol>
         </font>
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>When the Use Selected Bid and Line data button is clicked, CrewBid will fill the appropriate Block Time and Release Time text fields with data from the previous month's line.</p>

<p>When a bid file is opened, the Previous Month Bid popup button will contain all bid files from the previous month that are in the home/Library/CrewBid folder. For example, if the current bid file is for October 2004, all bid files for September 2004 will be available in the Previous Month Bid popup button. If there are no bid files for the previous month, the Previous Month Bid popup button will state "No Previous Bid Month Available". In this case, you would not be able to use previous month bid data, and the Line text field would be disabled.</p>

<p>Initially, the bid file selected in the Previous Month Bid popup button will be the bid that most closely matches the crew base and seat position of the current bid. If you have changed domiciles or seat positions from the previous month, the correct previous month bid file may not be selected in the Previous Month Bid popup button. In that case, you would need to select the appropriate bid file from the available choices in the Previous Month Bid popup button.</p>
