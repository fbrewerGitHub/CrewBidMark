<h3>Overlap Overview</h3>

<table bgcolor="e2e2e2">
   <tr>

<p>CrewBid's overlap features allow you to identify those lines in the current bid period that overlap with the previous month's flying schedule. In determining whether a line has an overlap, CrewBid considers the following to be an overlap conflict:
   <ul>
      <li>
      total block (flight) time in any seven day period exceeds 30 hours,
      </li>
      <li>
      consecutive work days exceed six without an intervening 24-hour rest period, and
      </li>
      <li>
      the report time of the first trip in the current month is less than nine hours from the release time of the last trip in the previous month.
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>Because of the many possible solutions, this version of CrewBid does not attempt to resolve an overlap conflict. Instead, CrewBid merely indicates that a line has an overlap conflict by coloring the pay for that line <a href="brown.htm"><font color="brown">brown</font></a> in the Lines Table.</p>

<h4>The Overlap Tab</h4>

<p>Refer to the Overlap Tab below for the discussion of the Overlap features of CrewBid.</p>

<p>In the Overlap Tab, you can:
   <ul>
      <li>
      <a href="prev_month.htm">automatically enter</a> trip data from the previous month's bid and line,
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="prev_month.htm">manually enter</a> additional data for trips that you have picked up and delete trip data for trips you have dropped, and
      </li>
      <li>
      tell CrewBid to compute overlap based on the automatically and manually entered trip data.
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>You may select lines that do not have overlap and assign points to lines that have overlap in the Select/Points Tab.</p>
