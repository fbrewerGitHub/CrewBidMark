The Color Brown
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Helvetica">
The color <font color="brown">brown</font> is that color that you might see inside the collar of a pilot shirt that you've worn every day of summer four-day or where you've spilled RoundUp on the lawn in front of your house. It indicates that the object is tainted, spoiled, or otherwise damaged. <font color="brown">Brown</font> is used in the Pay column of the  Lines Table to indicate that a line has overlap, as the pay for that line will probably be less than indicated, and thus is tainted, spoiled, or otherwise damaged.
