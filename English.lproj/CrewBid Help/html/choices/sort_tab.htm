<h2>Making Bid Choices</h2>

<h4>The Sort Tab</h4>

<p>Lines are sorted in the Sort Tab of the Choices Tab View.</p>

<p>The default sort for lines in the Lines Table is by line number.</p>

<p>To change the way lines are sorted, move a sort attribute from the Available column to the In Use column. Sort attributes may be moved between columns by double-clicking on the attribute or dragging from one column to the other.</p>

<p>Lines will be sorted by attributes in the order that they appear in the In Use column. The order of attributes in the In Use column may be changed by dragging an attribute to a new position in the column.</p>

<p>For flight attendant first round bids, lines that are considered equal by the sort criteria are sorted by position according to the order in the table under the Sort equal lines by label. To change the way equal lines are sorted, drag a position letter to the desired order in the table. (Pilot bids and flight attendant second round bids do not have the Sort equal lines by table.)</p>

<p>Other selections that affect the sort order can be made in the Lines Menu section under Help Topics.</p>
