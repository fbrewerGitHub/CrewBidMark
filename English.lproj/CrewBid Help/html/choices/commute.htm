<h2>Selecting Lines and Assigning Points</h2>

<h3>Commuting</h3>

<img src="../../graphics/commute.png"></img>

</br>
</br>

<p>The Commuting choices allow you to select and assign points to lines by:
	<ul>
		<li>
		the number of commutes to domicile required, and 
		</li>
		<li>
		the number of overnights in domicile required.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The number of commutes required for a line is determined by:
	<ul>
		<li>
		the number of trips in the line, and 
		</li>
		<li>
		whether back-to-back trips require an overnight in domicile.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The number of overnights in domicile for a line is determined by:
	<ul>
		<li>
		the start and end times for each day of the week, and 
		</li>
		<li>
		whether back-to-back trips require an overnight in domicile.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Normally, for commuting purposes, back-to-back trips should be considered to require an overnight in domicile. (A back-to-back trip is a trip that has either another trip that ends the day before the trip begins or another trip the begins the day after the trip ends.) If back-to-back trips require an overnight in domicile, the number of commutes required for a line will be the number of blocks of back-to-back trips. If back-to-back trips do not require an overnight in domicile, the number of commutes required for a line will be the number of trips.</p>

<p>Whether back-to-back trips are considered to require an overnight in domicile also affects the number of overnights in domicile for a line. If back-to-back trips require an overnight in domicile:
	<ul>
		<li>
		each pair of back-to-back trips require an overnight in domicile, 
		</li>
		<li>
		each trip that begins a block of back-to-back trips or is not back-to-back, and departs before the earliest depart time, requires an overnight in domicile, and
		</li>
		<li>
		each trip that ends a block of back-to-back trips or is not back-to-back, and arrives after the latest arrive time, requires an overnight in domicile.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>If back-to-back trips do not require an overnight in domicile, then an overnight in domicile will be required for each trip that departs before the earliest depart time, and an overnight in domicile will be required for each trip that arrives after the latest arrival time.</p>
