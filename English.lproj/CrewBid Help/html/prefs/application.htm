<h2>Setting Preferences</h2>

<h3>Application</h3>

<p>The Application Tab is where you set preferences for AM/PM times (applicable to flight attendant bids only) and whether your bid is automatically saved prior to submitting a bid.</p>

<h4>AM Earliest Departure and Latest Arrival Times</h4>

<p>The AM earliest departure and latest arrival times are used by flight attendant bids to determine whether a trip is an AM trip or a PM trip. Trips that depart prior to the AM earliest departure time and arrive prior to the AM latest arrival time are considered AM trips. Trips that depart after the AM earliest departure time or arrive after the AM latest arrival time are considered PM trips.</p>

<p>Changing the AM time preferences will update any open flight attendant bids to show the new AM and PM trips for each line. Flight attendant bids that are opened after the AM time preferences are changed will be updated to reflect the AM and PM trips for each line.</p>

<p>Because pilot bid data indicates whether a trip is an AM or PM trip, pilot bids do not use the AM times.</p>

<h4>Automatically save before submitting a bid</h4>

<p>Selecting the Automatically save before submitting a bid checkbox will cause a bid to be saved prior to the bid being submitted.</p>
