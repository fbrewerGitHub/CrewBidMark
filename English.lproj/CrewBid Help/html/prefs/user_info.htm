<h2>Setting Preferences</h2>

<h3>User Info</h3>

<p>The User Info Tab is where you enter employee number, crew position, and avoidance and buddy bids. (You can change the employee number for whom a bid is submitted, either temporarily or permanently, and enter avoidance and buddy bids in the bid submission dialog, just prior to submitting a bid.)</p>

<h4>Employee Number</h4>

<p>Employee Number is the employee for whom bids will be submited.</p>

<h4>Crew Position</h4>

<p>Crew Position is the position for which bids will be submitted. (While it is possible to submit a bid for another employee, pilots cannot submit bids for flight attendants and vice versa.)</p>

<p>The Crew Position selection determines whether avoidance or buddy bids are displayed, as explained below.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Avoidance and Buddy Bids</h4>

<p>When a pilot crew position (Captain or First Officer) is selected, three avoidance bids are available, as shown in the window below.</p>
