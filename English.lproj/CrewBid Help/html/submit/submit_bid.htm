<h2>Submitting a Bid</h2>

<p>CrewBid will automatically connect to the SWA server to submit your bid preferences.</p>

      <p>Note: Before submitting a bid, always confirm that you are submitting the bid for the correct employee number. Because any pilot can submit a bid for any other pilot (and, likewise, any flight attendant for any flight attendant), the employee number for whom a bid will be submitted (shown near the top of the Submit Bid dialog)  may or not be the same as the SWALife User ID of the person submitting the bid (shown near the bottom of the dialog).</p>
