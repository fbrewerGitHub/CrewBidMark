The CBAppController class is the delegate of NSApplication and is instantiated
in the MainMenu nib. It implements actions for menu items that are available
at all times (as opposed to menu items that are available only when a
document is open). It also implements methods that check that required system
resources are available, creates required directories, displays appropriate
windows at startup, and implements application delegate methods.
